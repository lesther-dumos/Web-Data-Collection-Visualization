# Web-Data-Collection-Visualization

Purpose of this repository is to practice the process of collecting data through the implementation of Python from Colab. The website used in this practice is YouTube. I am collecting information based on the search query. From that point I am inspecting the elements and retrieving the information such as video url, username, title, date of creation, etc. In this case, I am only looking at the data showcasing the short description of the video and creating a visualization out of it through [wordart.com.](https://wordart.com/) 

### Topic
The subject I chose for this lab is the social issue of homelessness. The reason why I chose this is because the steady trend of homelessness increased in the last few years. Influenced by factors such as cost of living and affordability of houses, it has become a huge problem. Oftentimes as I commute to school and back, many occasions I see homeless taking shelter in public transportation for temporary housing. As well as fields filled with tents and litters that surround it. Due to this, I created two visualizations that in hindsight shows the issue of homelessness; whereas the other one shows support programs that shelters homeless people. Down below are the parameters that I used for both subjects. 
1. Homelessness
- "Poverty Factors"
- "Homelessness Causes"
- "Hostile Archetecture Homelessness"
2. Housing Support
- "Homelessness Solutions"
- "Homelessness Advocacy Organizations"
- "Homeless shelters and support services"
### Purpose
The idea behind this lab is to explore the media portrayal of both subjects. Whether words carry a positive or negative connotation to the corresponding subjects, and/or any words have a significance to them compared to others. 

## Analysis
1. Visualizations
- [Homelessness(Image 1)](/assests/homeless_causes.csv)
- [Housing Support(Image 2)](/img/homeless_services.png)
2. Data
- [CVS1](/assests/homeless_causes.csv)
- [CVS2](/assests/homeless_incentives.csv)

Image 1 of homelessness presents many negative connotation words. The visualization expresses words such as: hostile, attack, spikes, and Anti. All of which encompasses a negative emotion. Whereas the second image presents words such as: shelter, provide, live, family, service. These groups of words tend to show a level of comfortability opposed to the first image. Both images appear to highlight the word Homeless showcasing the topic of both visualizations. However, they represent opposing thoughts as they have been rendered to do so. 

These patterns are mainly originating from the search query that was adjusted to fit the topic. Many of the words in image one shows a narrative of homeless people being an issue in urban cities where architecture crosses paths. It shows how architecture has developed to incentivise homeless people away from the areas. It also shows a glimpse in how homeless people are treated from an outside lens. The second image showcases a different visualization as it was also programmed to do so. It provides many positive influences that shows the narrative of support groups. 

### Future Goals 
Reflecting my research, I would say that YouTube may not be exactly the best fit to collect data on this issue. Or at least the topics are not beneficial for the website. Mainly because the website aims to mainstream media to produce money. This may incentivise more opinionated videos, and less detailed content. I would say creating a program that instead collects data from studies that have been published by reliable institutions. 

When originally producing the visualizations, my expectations were slightly different. I was looking forward to more specific generated words that would allow for a better analysis. However it appears that most of the data collected was more abstract and showed a general portrayal of the issue.
